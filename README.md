The code works by receiving analog signals from the potentiometers on the controller, from them it sends PWM signals to the servomotors depending on the angle of the potentiometer
This code also has the capability to record and play secuences of movements replicating the positions of the servomotors before.
Also its been included a security system to avoid hard movments done by the user.

The code has been made to use with an MSP430F5529 microcontroller.
Materials used for the controller:
4 Potentiometers
3 pushbuttons
3 resistors
3 LEDs
PinHeaders
Screw-on terminal
